# Shark Foraging Prediction and Smart Tag Concept
This project aims to develop an AI-based model to predict shark foraging behavior 
using satellite data (SST, chlorophyll, salinity, etc.) and propose a concept tag 
that can transmit shark activity to a cloud system in real time.

## Team
- Abhishek Kumar 
- Abdul Kadir
- Rajdeep Ghosh
- Mansi Kumari

## Objectives
1. Build a predictive model using NASA ocean data.
2. Design a conceptual IoT tag for real-time shark behavior tracking.

## Timeline
- Week 1: Data gathering + patent concept + model plan
- Week 2: Model building
- Week 3: Evaluation + tag concept documentation
- Week 4: Final report + presentation
